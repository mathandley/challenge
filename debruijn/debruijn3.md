# The Polymorphic lambda calculus

*Reference files:* [Poly](src/Poly.hs) and [Subst](src/Subst.hs)

Now that we know how to implement substitution generically, we can use it *twice* in our implementation of System F --- once for types and once for terms. Let's do it first with weakly-typed substitutions. In [Part IV](debruijn4.md) we will add type indices to make everything strongly-typed.

Our datatype definition includes new forms of types for
type variables (`VarTy`) and polymorphism (`PolyTy`). At the level of terms, polymorphic types are introduced at a type abstraction (`TyLam`), and instantiated at a type application (`TyApp`).

```haskell
data Ty = IntTy | Ty :-> Ty | VarTy Idx | PolyTy Ty
    deriving (Eq, Show)

data Exp :: Type where

 IntE   :: Int
        -> Exp

 VarE   :: Idx
        -> Exp

 LamE   :: Ty       -- type of binder
        -> Exp      -- body of abstraction
        -> Exp

 AppE   :: Exp      -- function
        -> Exp      -- argument
        -> Exp

 TyLam  :: Exp      -- bind a type variable
        -> Exp

 TyApp  :: Exp      -- type function
        -> Ty       -- type argument
        -> Exp
```

We actually need three forms of substitution for this language: types-in-types, types-in-terms, and terms-in-terms.

The first two are generally straightforward and follow directly from the pattern shown in [Part I](debruijn1.mdf). In particular, they traverse the argument, use `applySub` for variables, and `lift` when going under a binder.

## Types-in-types

For substitution into types, we need only create an instance of the `SubstDB` type class for the `Ty` syntax.

```haskell
instance SubstDB Ty where
    var = VarTy

    subst s IntTy       = IntTy
    subst s (t1 :-> t2) = subst s t1 :-> subst s t2
    subst s (VarTy x)   = applySub s x
    subst s (PolyTy t)  = PolyTy (subst (lift s) t)
```

## Types-in-terms

```haskell
substTy :: Sub Ty -> Exp -> Exp
substTy s (IntE x)     = IntE x
substTy s (VarE n)     = VarE n
substTy s (LamE t e)   = LamE (subst s t) (substTy s e)
substTy s (AppE e1 e2) = AppE (substTy s e1) (substTy s e2)
substTy s (TyLam e)    = TyLam (substTy (lift s) e)
substTy s (TyApp e t)  = TyApp (substTy s e) (subst s t)
```

## Terms-in-terms

The only part that requires thought is the `TyLam` case of term-in-term substitution.

```haskell
instance SubstDB Exp where
   var = VarE

   subst s (IntE x)     = IntE x
   subst s (VarE x)     = applySub s x
   subst s (LamE ty e)  = LamE ty (subst (lift s) e)
   subst s (AppE e1 e2) = AppE (subst s e1) (subst s e2)
   subst s (TyLam e)    = TyLam (subst (incTy s) e)  
   subst s (TyApp e ty) = TyApp (subst s e) ty
 ```  

In this case, we are going under a binder, but it is a type-variable binder, not a term-variable binder. Because of that difference, we need to shift the type variables in the range of the term substitution, but we don't need to do anything else. We do this shifting with the auxiliary function, `incTy`, defined below. Conveniently, substitutions are functors, so we can just use `fmap`.

```haskell
-- | Increment all types in an expression substitution
incTy :: Sub Exp -> Sub Exp
incTy = fmap (substTy incSub)
```
